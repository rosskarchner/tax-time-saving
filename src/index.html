            <h2>Saving for the future</h2>
            <p>
                Thinking about starting a retirement account?
                The Department of the Treasury has a new
                retirement savings account option called myRA.
                Here’s what makes myRA a good savings option:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>It’s simple.</b>
                    If you have unexpected expenses you can withdraw your money
                    any time you want with no penalty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>It’s safe.</b>
                    Because the U.S. Treasury backs myRA, your investments are secure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>It’s affordable.</b>
                    The myRA has no maintenance fees, and you can contribute
                    as little as you want on a one-time or ongoing basis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>It’s portable.</b>
                    If you change jobs you won’t have to transfer your myRA account.
                </li>
            </ul>

                By setting up direct deposit with the IRS, you send your refund to
                one, two, or even three accounts next year.
